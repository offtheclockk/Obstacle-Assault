Project is: no longer being worked on. I only created this project to teach myself the basics of Unreal Engine 5 and C++, and am currently working on other projects to deepen my knowledge.


## Room for Improvement
I would love to work on creating different levels with gradually more difficult obstacles.

Room for improvement:
- Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty
